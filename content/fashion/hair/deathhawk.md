So I am not one that is normally nervous about drastic hair changes as I have
gone through a few of my own before.  However, my most recent hair adventure did
make me nervous for a little bit. I will start with some back story that lead up
to my current style.

My hair transformations started in middle school when my mom bought me
a "natural" burgundy type hair color from the store.  It was fun to change my
hair color to something not dirty blonde (my natural hair color).  My next big
change came in freshman year of high school.  I chopped my shoulder length hair
to the length of the bottom of my ears, except for the front parts on both
sides.  We left those 2 front chunks chin length then dyed those bright red and
the back part black. I was kind of going for "anime" hair and got it.  Did the
dying it all black thing for a bit and let it grow back out.  Next fun adventure
was doing an extreme A-line cut with black on top and blue underneath on one
side and purple on the other. Then just black and purple, then all purple, then
just black for various work reasons.  Most recently I had let my hair grow out
the longest it had been since high school for my wedding and it was died all
purple.  After the wedding I chopped my hair back to above shoulder length,
which was about 6 inches, and we started adding blue into the front chunks and
around my head.  Then it was back to an A line cut and keeping the back part
underneath shaves a little.

I get hot very easy, always have, and I live in the south.  I never got very
good at styling long hair so that's why it never stayed long for a whole lot of
time.  If I wasn't going to make my hair pretty and just keep putting it up in
a ponytail because I feel like it's a million degrees, then might as well chop
it off to point it can still be up but I have less hair to deal with.  This got
me thinking about undercuts and possibly shaving a bigger part of my underside
to relieve some heat.  I have been into goth, lolita, visual kei, and other such
alternative cultures and looks since high school.  So when I start looking at
undercuts, I start looking at ones that aren't the norm per se.  I started
looking at the ones dyed all sorts of fun colors and had designs in them, and
even ones that had glitter.  I love shiny things, and yes you can be goth and
love sparkles.  Then I ran into the Deathhawk and was fascinated.

Once I had a name for what I was looking for it was easier to find styles and
pictures and videos of this haircut and the fun things you can do with it.  The
idea was very appealing because about half of your head is shaved and I can
still put my remaining hair up.  Less hair trapping the heat from my head and
I can still get the hair out of my face.  Less shampoo and such I have to use on
my hair so less time maintaining my hair.  Plus I can do things like put glitter
in my undercut or body paint (my husband does body painting and we have
airbrush).  Less hair I have to dye as well.  Sounds perfect!  Let's do this!

Then I run across someone putting colored wool dreads in their deathhawk and I'm
amazed.  I've seen dreads and such before, but not really with half of their
head shaved as well.  So I started looking into dreads as well to go with this
new hair style I wanted.  After researching a lot of things, I decided on buying
my own wool and making my own to put in my hair once I got the awesome hair cut.
And decided not to re-dye my hair as I don't want my hair dye to possibly dye
the wool every time I have to wash my hair.  So I was going to have less
maintenance one way and added some back with the dreads and figure it balances
out.  With dreads I can "change" my hair color more often as I change the dreads
and can change the style by the placement of them.  If I end up not liking
dreads, no harm no foul, I can go back to dying my remaining hair.  I still get
the benefits of fun hair color and style and less hair on my head so I can be
cooler temperature wise and keep my hair out of my face.

I tell my hairdresser about my idea.  She's never done this type of hair style
before, at least not to a female.  She has been the done doing my hair
transformations for a long time now, so  she's not all too surprised that I want
to do something completely different.  Now that she is up for the challenge (the
cutting part, not the dreads part), and we have everything set up, is when
I started getting a little nervous.

This was a new feeling for me.  Before and/or during my previous hair-ventures,
I never really got nervous.  I was just excited.  My hair stylist is awesome and
I've known her most of my life.  So she knows me, knows my hair, and I trust
her.  And sometimes we would run into things, and she would help me change the
design so it would work with my hair and face.  "No you can't do that style
exactly because that person's hair is very thin and yours is thicker than
a bush."  Or when we weren't sure how a color might turn out because we weren't
going to bleach my hair until it was full platinum just to put a color on
because we didn't want to melt my hair off.  So I would always say things like
"It's just hair, go for it.  Worse case we just cut more off, or I go to all
black again."  I was up for trying odd colors, or seeing what happened when you
mixed things different or we change the style to suit my face more.

This time though I started realizing my hair had not been buzzed short except
for a small part in the back.  This was going to be about half of my head gone.
My hair had not been that short since I was a baby.  I love my hair.  The fun
colors I've done (and still have), the feel of it, everything.  Was it really
"just hair"? Not much I could do if I didn't like the haircut once it had
happened except let it grow out.  Thankfully my hair grows like a weed right now
so it wouldn't take horrifically long to grow it back out.  But still, it was
a decent amount to cut off all at once.  Was this really what I wanted to try
next? Is there a going back since I already bought the things for making dreads?
Will it look as good on me as it does on the multitudes of others I found?  What
if my head looks funny buzzed?  I can't change the shape of my head.

Well, I decided to stick with my decision and just get it done.  In the end, it
is just hair.  I'm privileged to have it, have so much of it, and the ability
for it to grow quick.  So while I have the time and ability to enjoy this
privilege then that is what I am going to do.  Try new things I find interesting
and beautiful.  It was a fun journey going through the searching, deciding,
nervousness, and the actual doing.  I'm enjoying my new style and love having
a bit less hair.  I'm so glad I went through with it.  Now it's time for my next
adventure and start making the dreads to put in my new awesome hair style.
